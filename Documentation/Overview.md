# Overview

````
app-name subcommands... parameters...
````

The command line arguments are defined to have three parts
1. Subcommands (including the main app command)
2. Unamed parameters
3. Named parameters

## Parts

- **Subcommands** must come first;
- **Unnamed** and **named** params must come after **subcommands** but do not 
have to be ordered;
- Even though **unamed** params can be mixed with named params, **unamed** params 
are stored with orders;
