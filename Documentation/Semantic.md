# Semantics

The followings are accomplished in the semantic stage, in order:
1. Resolve paths
2. Merge option + primitive into option if option's value is empty and is not supposed to take 
boolean
3. Type check params and options

The semantic stage would work on an existing `ASTContext` generated by the AST stage
rather than creating new constructs.
