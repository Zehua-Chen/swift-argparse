# Semantics

The followings are accomplished in the semantic stage, in order:
1. Resolve paths
2. Merge option + primitive into option if option's value is empty and is not supposed to take 
boolean
3. Process alias options
4. Type check options
3. Type check parameters

The semantic stage would work on an existing `ASTContext` generated by the AST stage
rather than creating new constructs.
