# Semantics

The followings are accomplished in the semantic stage, in order:
1. Resolve paths
1. Resolve abbreviated boolean options
2. Resolve abbreviated options 
3. Type check params and options
4. Custom semantic stage

The semantic stage would work on an existing `ASTContext` generated by the AST stage
rather than creating new constructs.
